# Generating Schemas

there are 3 schema files that have to be kept in sync with one another to avoid conflicts:

- `schema.prisma`
- `schema.gql`
- `schema.generated.ts`

## Changes to the Prisma Schema

when you change `schema.prisma` you must re-run `prisma generate` (`npm run prisma:gen`), this regenerates both the `prisma` and the `pothos` types

depending on what models were changed you must find the corresponding models in the `pothos` type files

ex: if the `User` model changed then you would also have to update `./src/server/gql/type/user.ts` to reflect the change made so that the graphql schema is aware of the change

the type generation will help you here as it can suggest fields you're adding or mark fields you removed as an error

anytime the prisma schema changes your [database will need to be reset](../local-env-guides.md#resetting-your-database) to reflect the changes made

## Changes to the Graphql Schema

you are not meant to change `schema.gql` manually, this file is auto generated by `pothos`

the `schema.gql` file will automatically change based on changes to files within `./src/server/gql`, whenever a `builder` function is edited it affects the schema

if you are adding a new file to the `./src/server/gql` folders then you must also remember to import that file into `./src/server/gql/schema.ts` so it gets included in the generated schema

the schema file is only generated when the `/api/gql` endpoint is hit, so if you do not have the dev server running you'll have to start it and visit `/api/gql` to trigger the the schema file to generate

## Changes to the GQTY Schema

you are not meant to edit `schema.generated.ts` manually, as the file name suggests it's generated by the `gqty:gen` script (`npm run gqty`)

anytime the graphql schema changes the GQTY schema must also be updated / re-generated
