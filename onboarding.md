If you are new to the EF IT team this page details the steps you'll need to take to begin working with the rest of the team

1. Join the EF Slack

   You'll have access to this Slack with your EF Google account. Please make sure you join with that email address.

   Slack is used as the main method of communication within the organization

   There is also a mobile app for Slack that can be used if you prefer

   Please join the following channels:

   - [`#technology-and-innovation`](https://empowered-futures.slack.com/archives/C02F9BRQ3LL) - all designers, devs etc working on tech products
   - [`#onboarding-devs`](https://empowered-futures.slack.com/archives/C04NZJN9C6Q) - to find your feet as a dev on the project and get set up
   - [`#dev-standups`](https://empowered-futures.slack.com/archives/C054DRLUNKC) - to interact with the bot to report your progress and how you're feeling about the work each week

   Once you're assigned to specific projects, you'll be able to join one or more of the more specific channels for those. The main three are:

   - [`#internal-project`](https://empowered-futures.slack.com/archives/C04FFB45W5Q) - for development of the internal task management app

   **Once joined please introduce yourself in the `#technology-and-innovation` channel**

   Once you've joined the `#dev-standups` channel you'll be included in the weekly async standup message. each week the bot will message you and ask what you've been up to.
