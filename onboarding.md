# Onboarding

If you are new to the EF IT team this page details the steps you'll
need to take to begin working with the rest of the team

1. Join the EF Slack

   You'll have access to this Slack with your EF Google account

   Slack is used as the main method of communication within the
   organization

   there is also a mobile app for Slack that can be used if you
   prefer

   [Slack Link](https://join.slack.com/t/empowered-futures/shared_invite/zt-1hxgpij6a-J93vroAa9AfuHZhc4UZGog)

2. Join the Trello

   You'll have access to trello with your EF google account

   Trello is used by the development team to track tasks that need to
   be accomplished week by week

   Each week's tasks are referred to as a _sprint_

   [Trello Link](https://trello.com/invite/b/YYDqebhj/ATTI255eb7190978b439f0f2b7274ba2e46a16D7028D/mentorship-platform)

3. Join the GitHub Repo's

   There are multiple repositories that are under active development
   within the IT team

   - [Mentorship Platform Backend](https://github.com/empoweredfutures/EF_Back)
   - [Internal Project (Task Management App)](https://github.com/empoweredfutures/internalFE)

   You don't need access to all these repos just the ones you intend
   to work on
