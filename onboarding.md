If you are new to the EF IT team this page details the steps you'll
need to take to begin working with the rest of the team

1. Join the EF Slack

   You'll have access to this Slack with your EF Google account. Please make sure you join with that email address.

   Slack is used as the main method of communication within the
   organization

   There is also a mobile app for Slack that can be used if you
   prefer

   Please join the following channels:

   - `#technology-and-innovation`
   - `#onboarding-devs`
   - `#dev-standups`

   Once you're assigned to specific projects, you'll be able to join more specific channels for those.

   **Once joined please introduce yourself in the `#technology-and-innovation` channel**

   Once you've joined the `#dev-standups` channel you'll be included in the weekly async standup message. each week the bot will message you and ask what you've been up to.

1. Join the Trello

   You'll have access to Trello with your EF google account

   Trello is used by the development team to track tasks that need to
   be accomplished week by week

   Each week's tasks are referred to as a _sprint_

   The mentorship platform and the task management app have different boards
