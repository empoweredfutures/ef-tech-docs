## EF Connect

EF Connect (internally known as the Mentorship Platform or MP for short) is Empowered Futures’ core product. It is an online platform connecting young people seeking guidance (i.e., mentees) with experienced professionals (i.e., mentors) ready to mentor and support their growth. It allows mentees to create a profile, search for and send mentorship requests to mentors who are registered in the mentorship platform, and schedule meetings based on the mentors’ availability.
